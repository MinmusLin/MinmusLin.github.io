- *2024 / 03 - 2025 / 03*, Lightweight Network for 3D Image Sensor Signal Enhancement

  *National-level Student Innovation Training Project - Lead Researcher*

  - **Description:** This research addresses the issues of high power consumption and computational complexity in Time-of-Flight (ToF) 3D imaging technology on edge devices by proposing a lightweight, high-performance 3D image processing algorithm. Through dynamic convolution kernel design, multi-scale detail optimization, and network pruning techniques, the model's parameter count and computational burden are significantly reduced while maintaining high-precision imaging performance, providing a feasible solution for ToF sensor applications in mobile and embedded devices.
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Designed multi-scale dynamic convolution kernels with adaptive kernel range adjustment to enhance detail capture capability, achieving a 15% reduction in computational complexity on the DeepCGLR network.
    - Combined weight pruning (L1 regularization) with sparse connection strategies to eliminate redundant parameters, reducing model parameters by 40% and compressing memory usage to 35% of the original model.
    - Successfully deployed the algorithm on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX platform, achieving a 50% reduction in power consumption, a 2x improvement in inference speed, and meeting real-time requirements (30fps).
    - Tested with real ToF sensor data, maintaining a PSNR above 32dB on CPU/integrated GPU environments, significantly outperforming traditional methods (28dB).
    - Proposed a collaborative optimization framework for lightweight models and sensor hardware, providing algorithmic support for future "sensor-computing integration" chip design.
  - **Achievements:** The project successfully achieved lightweight and efficient ToF 3D imaging algorithms, reducing model parameters by 40%, improving edge inference speed by 2x, and lowering power consumption by 50%, with real-time validation (30fps) on Jetson Orin NX. The technology can be applied to smartphones, AR/VR, and autonomous driving, advancing 3D imaging toward low-power, high-real-time edge computing scenarios.

<div class="paper-box-text" markdown="1">
- *2023 / 03 - 2024 / 03*, Access Control Mask Detection System

  *Provincial-level Student Innovation Training Project - Lead Researcher*

  - **Description:** In the post-pandemic era, we developed a multi-class real-time mask detection system based on YOLOv8 for automated access control in high-traffic areas (e.g., schools, transit hubs). The system not only identifies whether masks are worn but also further distinguishes between proper wearing, improper wearing, and no mask states, significantly improving control accuracy and scenario adaptability.
  - **Responsibilities:**
    - Implemented a multi-class mask detection model using the YOLOv8 framework, enhancing small-object detection performance through network structure optimization.
    - Conducted systematic data collection and cleaning, employing oversampling techniques and class weighting to address class imbalance during model training.
    - Developed a visual interface for the access control system using the Qt framework, integrating real-time detection, alarm logging, and permission management functionalities.
    - Designed a dynamic threshold mechanism to automatically adjust detection sensitivity based on crowd density, balancing false positive rates and recall.
  - **Achievements:** The system achieved >95% detection accuracy in real-world testing, enabling automated, scalable mask enforcement while reducing labor costs by ~60% at pilot sites. Its low-latency edge deployment proved highly effective in high-traffic environments, contributing to safer public spaces during pandemic recovery.
